# ClubHopper

GREETING FELLOW CLUBBERS!!!

Welcome to my clubhopper gem!

This gem will scrape this weekends events from websites of some of the best clubs in NYC!

Once the gem has been installed (see Installation instructions below):
run "./bin/clubhopper"

ULTIMATELY... as this gem grows in funtionality and scale, it will be able to do the following:

1. You will be asked to choose from the available venues
2. You will be asked to choose a specific date to get a link to more info 
3. Will ask if you would like to open that link in a browser window 
4. During this procedure you can enter "exit" to exit the program

BUT...for now in v.1 of the Club Hopper we will focus on Cielo in Manhattan.

1. A list of Cielo's upcoming events will be displayed with its respective index number
2. To get a link to more detailed info on a specific indexed event you will be asked to select a number from that index 
3. Link information will be provided and you will be asked if you would like to open this link in a browser window

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'club_hopper'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install club_hopper

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
